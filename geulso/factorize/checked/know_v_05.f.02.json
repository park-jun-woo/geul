      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "While a 'Somebody' is involved, the act of 'living something' (experiencing it) is often about undergoing rather than a strong, active will or intention from the subject concerning the experience itself. The verb focuses on the happening rather than the intentional act."

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of experiencing (living something) is semantically neutral; the inherent sentiment depends on the specific 'something' being experienced."

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The process of 'living something' or experiencing can be both volitional (e.g., 'He lived a full life') and non-volitional (e.g., 'She lived through a war'). Given this variability, a neutral stance is most appropriate for the general verb sense."
