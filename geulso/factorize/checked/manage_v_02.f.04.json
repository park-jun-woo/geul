      "reasoning": "The definition 'be in charge of, act on, or dispose of' implies an ongoing series of actions to maintain a state of control or handle a situation, aligning with 'process'. The property is clearly about exercising control or authority, as reinforced by the hypernym 'control.v.01'. The verb 'deal' in the frame is interpreted as a placeholder for 'manage', consistent with the task's general instruction and sample usage of '----s'.",
