      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, describing an action or process."

    "Modality": {
      "value": 1.0,

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of making something 'goof-proof' is functionally neutral. While its purpose is to prevent negative events, the act itself doesn't inherently carry a positive or negative sentiment."

    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The term 'goof-proof' implies a high degree of certainty or reliability in the object's resistance to errors once the action is complete."
