      "value": "An agent causes an alteration in the physiological state of a patient.",
      "reasoning": "Based on the definition 'dope (a racehorse)' and the hypernym 'give a narcotic to', the verb describes an action where 'Somebody' (agent) induces a change in the internal, biological state of 'something' (patient)."

    "MeansOfChange": {
      "value": "The alteration is achieved through the administration of a narcotic or doping substance.",
      "reasoning": "The core meaning of 'soup' in this context is 'to dope', which inherently specifies the use of a narcotic substance as the means to effect the physiological change."
