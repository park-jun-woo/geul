    "EmotionalState": {
      "value": "A state of emotional agitation or excitement.",
      "reasoning": "Derived directly from the verb's definition 'be in an agitated or excited state', and supported by the hypernym 'seethe.v.02' which describes an agitated emotional state."

    "Experiencer": {
      "value": "Somebody",
      "reasoning": "The 'Somebody' in the verb frame is the entity that experiences this emotional state."

  "qualifiers": {
    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb describes an internal state that is typically directly experienced by the subject or observed through outward manifestations."
    },
    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, describing a state of being."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "Being in an agitated state is generally not an act of will; it is a state one finds oneself in, rather than intentionally performing."

    "Tense": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "No specific tense is implied by the verb's core meaning; defaults to present for general statement of state."

      "value": 0,
      "reasoning": "The verb describes a continuous state rather than a punctual event or a result, thus representing a simple aspect."

    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The state described by 'ferment' (agitation/excitement) is not volitionally chosen by the subject; it is a state they find themselves in, similar to cognitive or sensory states like 'know' or 'see'."

      "reasoning": "The verb expresses a definite state of being."
