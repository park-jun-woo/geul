  "sememes": {
    "VerbType": {
      "value": "Change",
      "reasoning": "The verb describes a transition from a state of not having spikes to having them, indicating a change in the entity's physical state."
    },
    "ProcessKind": {
      "value": "Growth/Development",
      "reasoning": "The definition 'bring forth' and the hypernym 'develop' suggest a natural, often biological, process of physical formation or emergence."
    },
    "Undergoer": {
      "value": "The 'Something' that develops spikes",
      "reasoning": "The 'Something' in the verb frame is the entity that undergoes this developmental process, acting as the patient of the change."
    },
    "ResultingFeature": {
      "value": "Anatomical 'spike(s)'",
      "reasoning": "The 'spike or spikes' are the specific physical features that are produced or emerge as the outcome of the growth process inherent in the verb's meaning."
    }
  },
  "qualifiers": {
    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The process of bringing forth spikes is typically a directly observable event."
    },
    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, stating a fact about a natural process."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something spike' indicates a non-agentive subject, meaning the action is not driven by will or intention."
    },
    "Tense": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "No specific tense information is provided, so a neutral/present interpretation is assumed for the core decomposition."
    },
    "Aspect": {
      "value": 0,
      "reasoning": "No specific aspect is indicated, so a simple, complete event is assumed for the core meaning."
    },
    "Politeness": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb 'spike' in this sense carries no inherent politeness level."
    },
    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The natural process of 'spiking' is semantically neutral; any positive or negative sentiment would depend on external context."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something spike' explicitly indicates a non-volitional subject, as 'Something' cannot act with intent."
    },
    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The definition describes a definite occurrence or process, implying certainty."
    },
    "Iterativity": {
      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "The verb describes a single instance of a developmental process where an entity brings forth spikes, rather than a continuous or repeated action."
