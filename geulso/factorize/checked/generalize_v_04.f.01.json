    "VerbType": {
      "value": "change",
      "reasoning": "The verb 'generalize' in this sense describes an entity undergoing a process of spreading or distribution, which is a change in its spatial configuration or location over time, aligning with the definition 'become systemic and spread throughout the body'."
    },
    "VerbProperty": {
      "value": "motion.n.03",
      "reasoning": "The core property undergoing change is the entity's motion and resulting distribution across an area, as implied by 'spread throughout the body' and the hypernym 'spread'."
    },
    "PatientRole": {
      "value": "patient.n.02",
      "reasoning": "The 'Something' in the verb frame is the entity that undergoes the change of state by spreading."
    },
    "LocationRole": {
      "value": "location.n.01",
      "reasoning": "The 'PP' (prepositional phrase) specifies the extent or area of the spreading (e.g., 'throughout the body'), serving as the spatial domain or destination of the motion."

  "qualifiers": {
    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The process of something becoming systemic and spreading is typically a directly observable phenomenon (e.g., a disease spreading)."
    },
    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, stating a process of change."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something is generalizeing PP' lacks an agent capable of will, indicating no volition or intention for the process."
    },
    "Tense": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The progressive aspect 'is generalizeing' typically implies a present or ongoing process, making the tense present/neutral without further context."
    },
    "Aspect": {
      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "The verb frame 'Something is generalizeing PP' uses the present progressive tense, directly indicating a progressive aspect."
    },
    "Politeness": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb itself carries no inherent politeness connotation; it is a neutral descriptor."
    },
    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of spreading or becoming systemic is semantically neutral; its positive or negative impact depends on the context (e.g., disease vs. information)."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something is generalizeing PP' describes an event happening to a non-agentive subject ('Something'), making the action inherently non-volitional."
    },
    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb describes a factual process, implying certainty in its occurrence."
    },
    "Iterativity": {
      "value": "MAX-1",
      "reasoning": "The process of 'spreading throughout the body' implies a continuous and highly repetitive series of small movements or distributions rather than a single instantaneous event."
