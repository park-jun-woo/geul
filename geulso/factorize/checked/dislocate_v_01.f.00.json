    "ActionType": {
      "value": "cause a change in physical position",
      "reasoning": "The verb 'dislocate' describes an action that moves something from its original or correct position, thus causing a change in its spatial state."
    },
    "ResultantState": {
      "value": "incorrect or abnormal position/alignment",
      "reasoning": "The 'out of position' aspect in the definition highlights the specific, undesirable state of misplacement or misalignment that results from the action."
    },
    "Agent": {
      "value": "Somebody (causal_agent.n.01)",
      "reasoning": "The 'Somebody' in the verb frame is the active entity initiating and causing the dislocation."

    "Patient": {
      "value": "something (patient.n.02)",
      "reasoning": "The 'something' in the verb frame is the entity that undergoes the change in position and ends up in an incorrect state."

    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of dislocating something is generally a directly observable event."

    },
    "Tense": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "No specific tense is indicated by the verb's decomposition, so neutral (present) is assumed."
    },
    "Aspect": {
      "value": 0,
      "reasoning": "The verb describes a simple, completed act of moving something out of position, without emphasizing ongoing nature or prior completion."

    "Polarity": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "To dislocate something typically implies damage, harm, or disorder (e.g., a dislocated joint, dislocated part), which carries a negative connotation."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Somebody dislocate something' explicitly indicates a volitional agent ('Somebody') performing the action."
