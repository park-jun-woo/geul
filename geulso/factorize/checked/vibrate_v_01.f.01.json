  "sememes": {
    "CoreAction": {
      "value": "Causes a rapid, oscillatory change in position",
      "reasoning": "The verb 'vibrate' describes an agent causing an object to undergo a rapid, back-and-forth movement, which is a change in its state of motion. This aligns with the hypernym 'move'."
    },
    "Agent": {
      "value": "causal_agent.n.01 (Somebody)",
      "reasoning": "The verb frame 'Somebody vibrate something' explicitly identifies a volitional agent initiating the action."
    },
    "Patient": {
      "value": "patient.n.02 (something)",
      "reasoning": "The verb frame identifies 'something' as the entity that is caused to undergo the rapid, oscillatory motion."
    },
    "MotionSpeed": {
      "value": "rapid.a.01",
      "reasoning": "The definition 'move back and forth rapidly' highlights the high speed as a fundamental characteristic of vibration."
    },
    "MotionPattern": {
      "value": "oscillatory.a.01",
      "reasoning": "The definition 'move back and forth' describes a repetitive, alternating direction of movement, which is characteristic of oscillation."

  "qualifiers": {
    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of causing something to vibrate is typically a directly observable phenomenon."
    },
    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, describing an action or state of being."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The presence of 'Somebody' in the frame implies the agent's will and intention in performing the action."
    },
    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of vibrating itself is semantically neutral; its positive or negative connotation depends on context."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Somebody ----s something' clearly indicates a volitional agent performing an intentional act."
    },
    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb describes a definite occurrence or an action being performed."
    },
    "Iterativity": {
      "value": "MAX-1",
      "reasoning": "Vibration is inherently a continuous, rapid, and highly repetitive movement, implying high iterativity."
