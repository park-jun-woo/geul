      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, describing an action or process."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The agent being 'Something' suggests that the action, while causative, does not imply human-like will or intention, aligning with samples for non-human subjects."

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of stirring is neutral; its sentiment depends on context or the outcome."

      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something stir something' indicates a non-human or non-agentive subject for the action, making the action non-volitional in the human sense, consistent with samples for 'Something' as agent."
