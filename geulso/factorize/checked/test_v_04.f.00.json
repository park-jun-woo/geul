  "sememes": {
    "VerbType": {
      "value": "state",
      "reasoning": "The definition 'show a certain characteristic when tested' describes the resultant state of an entity possessing a particular characteristic, as revealed through testing. It's not an action but a description of an intrinsic property or condition."
    },
    "VerbProperty": {
      "value": "property.n.01",
      "reasoning": "The core meaning is about an entity having a certain property or characteristic that is 'shown' or 'found' when subjected to a test, hence 'property'."
    },
    "Participant_Patient": {
      "value": "Somebody",
      "reasoning": "The 'Somebody' in the frame refers to the entity (e.g., a substance, a person) that possesses or shows the characteristic being described. This entity undergoes the implicit testing process and is the bearer of the revealed property."
    },
    "Participant_Attribute": {
      "value": "Adjective",
      "reasoning": "The 'Adjective' specifies the particular characteristic or quality that the patient is found to possess as a result of the test. It functions as an attribute of the patient."
    }
  },
  "qualifiers": {
    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb 'test' implies that the characteristic is determined through a testing process, which provides direct observational or empirical evidence of its presence."
    },
    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, stating a factual outcome or state regarding the subject's characteristics."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The subject of this verb frame (e.g., 'The water') is not acting with will or intention but rather exhibiting an inherent or revealed characteristic. The verb describes a state, not a willed action."
    },
    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb 'test' itself is neutral; the sentiment (positive or negative) is determined by the specific characteristic (adjective) that is revealed (e.g., 'tested positive for lead' vs. 'tested clean')."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The 'Somebody' in this frame refers to the entity being tested (e.g., a material, a biological sample), which non-volitionally exhibits a characteristic rather than intentionally performing an action."
    },
    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "When a characteristic is stated as 'tested' (e.g., 'the water tested positive'), it implies a high level of certainty about the presence or absence of that characteristic based on the test results."
    },
    "Iterativity": {
      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "The verb describes a single determination of a characteristic or a continuous state of possessing that characteristic as a result of being tested, rather than a repetitive action."
