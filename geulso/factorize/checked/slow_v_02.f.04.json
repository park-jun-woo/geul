      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of slowing up is semantically neutral; its positive or negative sentiment depends on the specific context."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Somebody slow_up' indicates that the action is performed by a volitional agent ('Somebody') who intentionally reduces their speed."
