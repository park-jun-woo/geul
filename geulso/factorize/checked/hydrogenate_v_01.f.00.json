    "VerbType": {
      "value": "change",
      "reasoning": "The definition 'combine or treat with... add hydrogen to the molecule' indicates an action that causes a transformation or alteration."
    },
    "VerbProperty": {
      "value": "chemical_composition.n.01",
      "reasoning": "The verb specifically describes altering the molecular structure by adding hydrogen, which directly impacts the chemical composition."

    "MeansOfChange": {
      "value": "by_adding_hydrogen",
      "reasoning": "The core of 'hydrogenate' specifies that the change is brought about by combining or treating with hydrogen."

      "value": "somebody",
      "reasoning": "The verb frame 'Somebody hydrogenate something' identifies 'Somebody' as the volitional actor initiating the chemical process."

    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "Hydrogenation is a scientific process that is typically directly observable or verifiable through experimentation."

    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, stating a factual action."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The presence of 'Somebody' in the frame implies an agent acting with clear intention and will to perform the chemical process."
    },
    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of hydrogenating is a neutral chemical process; its outcomes may have positive or negative implications depending on context, but the act itself is neutral."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Somebody hydrogenate something' explicitly includes a volitional agent ('Somebody'), making the action inherently intentional."
    },
    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of hydrogenation, when described, implies a definite and certain occurrence of the chemical process."

    "Iterativity": {
      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "The lexeme typically describes a single, complete instance of the chemical process. While it can be repeated, the verb itself refers to one act of transformation."
