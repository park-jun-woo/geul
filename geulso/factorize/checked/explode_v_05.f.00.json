    "Destruction": {
      "value": "The verb signifies an action that causes the complete destruction of an object's physical integrity. The 'Somebody' is the causal agent initiating this destruction, and the 'something' is the patient undergoing the change to a state of being destroyed.",
      "reasoning": "Derived from the definition 'destroy by exploding' and the hypernym 'destroy.v.02'. This represents a `change` in `integrity`."
    },
    "MannerOfAction": {
      "value": "The specific manner by which the destruction is achieved is through the process of an explosion, characterized by a rapid and forceful release of energy.",
      "reasoning": "Explicitly stated as 'by exploding' in the definition, this specifies the `manner.n.01` of the destruction, linking it to the concept of `explosion.n.01`."
    }

  "qualifiers": {
    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of exploding something is a directly observable phenomenon."
    },
    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, stating an event or action."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The presence of an agent ('Somebody') in the frame implies the action is driven by will and intention."
    },
    "Tense": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "No specific tense information is inherent to the verb's definition for this frame, so it defaults to present/neutral."
    },
    "Aspect": {
      "value": 0,
      "reasoning": "No specific aspect is inherent in the verb's base meaning for this frame; it describes a simple, completed action rather than ongoing or perfective."

    "Politeness": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb itself carries no inherent politeness implication."

      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of destroying something is generally considered to have a negative sentiment."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Somebody ----s something' explicitly includes a volitional agent ('Somebody'), making the action inherently volitional."
    },
    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The event of exploding something is described as a definite occurrence, not speculative."
    },
    "Iterativity": {
      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "The lexeme typically describes a single, completed event of causing an explosion and destruction, not a repeated action."
