    },
    "VerbProperty": {
      "value": "dominance.n.01",
      "reasoning": "The core meaning of 'predominate' is to have a state of superiority or prevalence, which is captured by 'dominance'."

    "CausalAgent": {
      "value": "causal_agent.n.01",
      "reasoning": "The 'Something' that exists in the state of being dominant or prevalent, as specified by the verb frame. Following the precedent of state verbs like 'know' and 'see', the subject is treated as the causal agent of the state."

    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "Predominate describes an objective state that is directly observable or verifiable."

    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, stating a fact or condition."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something rule' lacks an agent capable of will, and the verb describes a state, not an action driven by will."

    "Tense": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "No specific tense is implied by the verb's core meaning or the frame; a neutral (present) tense is assumed."
    },
    "Aspect": {
      "value": 0,
      "reasoning": "Predominate describes a continuous state of being, not an event with a specific temporal structure, hence simple aspect."

    "Politeness": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb itself does not carry an inherent politeness level; it is neutral."

    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The state of predominating is neutral; its positive or negative sentiment depends on context."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something rule' describes a state pertaining to a non-agentive subject ('Something'), making it inherently non-volitional. The verb itself denotes a state, not an intentional act."
