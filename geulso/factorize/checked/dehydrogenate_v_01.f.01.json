      "value": "change",
      "reasoning": "The definition 'remove hydrogen from' describes a process that alters the chemical state of a substance."

    "VerbProperty": {
      "value": "composition.n.01",
      "reasoning": "The verb specifically denotes a change in the chemical makeup or composition of the affected substance by taking away a component."

    "CausalAgent": {
      "value": "entity.n.01",
      "reasoning": "The first 'Something' in the verb frame acts as the entity that causes the removal of hydrogen, which could be a chemical agent, catalyst, or energy."
    },
    "Patient": {
      "value": "substance.n.01",
      "reasoning": "The second 'something' in the verb frame is the substance from which hydrogen is removed, thus undergoing a change in composition."

    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "Chemical reactions, including dehydrogenation, are generally described based on direct observation or scientific consensus."
    },
    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb describes a factual process or event, indicating a declarative mood."

    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The agent in the frame is 'Something', indicating a non-human entity (e.g., a chemical, catalyst, or heat) that does not possess will or intention."
    },
    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of dehydrogenation is a neutral chemical process, not inherently positive or negative."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something ----s something' implies a non-volitional agent (a non-living entity or force) performing the action."

    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The description of a chemical process typically implies a high degree of certainty about its occurrence."
    },
    "Iterativity": {
      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "The verb describes a single, distinct event of hydrogen removal, even if the overall process might be continuous."
