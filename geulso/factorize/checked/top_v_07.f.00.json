  "frame_text": "Somebody top something",
  "sememes": {
    "CoreActionAndResult": {
      "value": "The act of striking an object, specifically a ball, to impart a forward rotational motion (spin).",
      "reasoning": "The verb 'top' encompasses both the physical action of striking and its direct consequence of giving the object a forward spin, which defines its meaning."
    },
    "PointOfImpact": {
      "value": "The physical strike is directed at the top surface of the object.",
      "reasoning": "The precise location of the strike (the top part) is a defining characteristic of 'topping' and is crucial for achieving the specific forward spin."
    },
    "Agent": {
      "value": "A volitional individual or entity.",
      "reasoning": "The verb frame 'Somebody ----s something' explicitly indicates an animate agent who performs the action."
    },
    "Patient": {
      "value": "A physical object capable of receiving a strike and rotational motion (typically a ball).",
      "reasoning": "The 'something' in the verb frame is the object that is struck and whose motion state is changed by acquiring spin."
    }
  },
  "qualifiers": {
    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The action of 'topping' a ball is a directly observable physical event."
    },
    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, describing an action or event."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The presence of 'Somebody' in the frame implies that the agent acts with conscious will and intention, especially in a sporting context."
    },
    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of topping a ball is neutral in sentiment; its positive or negative valence depends on the context or whether it was intended."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Somebody ----s something' indicates a volitional agent performing the action, even if the outcome (e.g., an accidental top in golf) might be undesired, the swing itself is intentional."
    },
    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The event of topping is described as a definite occurrence."
    },
    "Iterativity": {
      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "The lexeme describes a single, discrete event of striking an object to impart spin."
