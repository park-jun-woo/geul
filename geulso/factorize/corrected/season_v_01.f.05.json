    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The agent 'Something' (e.g., salt, pepper) in this frame does not possess 'will' or 'intention' in the human sense, thus modality is neutral."

    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something season something' implies a non-human, non-animal agent ('Something') performing the action, which lacks volition."

    "Iterativity": {
      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "While seasoning might involve multiple applications (e.g., several pinches of salt), the verb 'season' typically refers to the overall process or a single completed act of imparting flavor, not a series of distinct, repetitive events."
