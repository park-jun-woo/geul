    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of emitting steam is neutral; its sentiment depends on context (e.g., a kettle steaming is neutral, a person steaming with rage might be negative)."

      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "For 'steam.v.02' meaning 'emit steam', even when the subject is 'Somebody', the action typically refers to involuntary emission (e.g., from body heat, anger), thus it is non-volitional."
