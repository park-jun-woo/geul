      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something convulse something' indicates that the causal agent is non-sentient or lacks will, hence no modality is involved."

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of causing contraction is semantically neutral; its positive or negative sentiment depends on context (e.g., muscle contraction vs. illness-induced convulsion)."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something convulse something' implies a non-volitional subject ('Something') as the causal agent, meaning the action is not intentional."

      "reasoning": "The lexeme 'convulse' in this frame refers to a single instance of causing contraction, although the contraction itself might be sustained or repetitive, the causation is treated as a single event."
