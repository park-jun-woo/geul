      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "Despite the generic 'Something' in the frame, the specific meaning of 'relent' (and 'give in' in this sense) refers to a conscious decision to cease opposition or to comply. This inherently implies a volitional act by an entity capable of such decisions, rather than a passive event."
