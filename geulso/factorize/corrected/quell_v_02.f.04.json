    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The core meaning of the verb describes a factual state or event, making it declarative."

      "value": 0.0,

    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of quelling is neutral; its sentiment depends on the specific context and what is being quelled."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something stay' implies that 'Something' is the entity undergoing the action or state. This 'Something' is typically not a volitional agent, making the action non-volitional from its perspective."

    "Aspect": {
      "value": 4,
      "reasoning": "The 'stay' component in 'Something stay' suggests that the frame emphasizes the enduring *result* of the quelling action (i.e., 'Something is quelled and remains in that state'). This aligns with the 'Result-focused' aspect."
