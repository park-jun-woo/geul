    "Action": {
      "value": "The action of causing an entity ('something') to become enclosed by an agent ('Somebody').",
      "reasoning": "This captures the core event of the verb 'stockade', identifying the agent and patient roles from the verb frame and the resulting state of enclosure."
    },
    "Means": {
      "value": "The enclosure is achieved specifically by using a stockade as the structural means.",
      "reasoning": "The term 'stockade' inherently defines the instrument or material used for the enclosing action, making it a crucial semantic component of the verb."
    },
    "Purpose": {
      "value": "The action is performed with the purpose of fortifying the enclosed entity.",
      "reasoning": "The definition explicitly states 'in order to fortify', indicating the defensive goal or intent behind the action."
    }

    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of stockading is a physical, observable event, suggesting direct experience as the source of information."

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb frame describes a factual event, aligning with a declarative mood."

    "Modality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The presence of 'Somebody' as the agent in the frame implies intentionality and strong will behind the action."

    "Politeness": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb 'stockade' itself carries no inherent politeness level; it is a neutral term."
    },
    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of stockading is generally neutral. While fortification can be positive for the protected entity, the process itself is not inherently positive or negative without further context."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Somebody ----s something' explicitly indicates a volitional agent performing an intentional action."

    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The statement describes a definite action or occurrence, implying certainty."
    },
    "Iterativity": {
      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "The lexeme 'stockade' conceptually describes a single, complete event of surrounding something with a stockade, even if the construction process is prolonged."
