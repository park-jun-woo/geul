  "sememes": {
    "Core Process": {
      "value": "Change in the intrinsic nature or characteristics of an entity.",
      "reasoning": "The verb 'dehumanize' (in this sense 'make mechanical or routine') inherently describes a transformation of an entity's qualities, moving it away from a 'human' or natural state towards a 'mechanical' one."
    },
    "Causal Agent": {
      "value": "The impersonal entity or factor causing the change.",
      "reasoning": "As indicated by the 'Something' in the subject position of the frame 'Something dehumanize something', this participant initiates the transformation."
    },
    "Patient": {
      "value": "The entity that undergoes the transformation.",
      "reasoning": "As indicated by the 'something' in the object position of the frame 'Something dehumanize something', this participant is affected by the change."
    },
    "Resulting State / Quality": {
      "value": "The state of becoming mechanical or routine.",
      "reasoning": "Directly derived from the definition 'make mechanical or routine', specifying the new quality or condition of the patient."
    }
  },
  "qualifiers": {
    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of making something mechanical or routine is generally a directly observable phenomenon or a consequence that can be directly experienced."
    },
    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, stating an event or process."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The agent in the frame is 'Something', which is non-volitional and lacks intention or will."
    },
    "Polarity": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb 'dehumanize' itself carries a negative connotation, implying a loss of positive human attributes or value, even if the resulting 'mechanical' state might be contextually neutral."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something ----s something' indicates that the action is performed by a non-agentive 'Something', making it inherently non-volitional."
    },
    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb describes a definite occurrence or a caused state."
    },
    "Iterativity": {
      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "The lexeme describes a single, albeit potentially prolonged, event of transformation leading to a changed state, rather than inherent repetition of the action itself."
