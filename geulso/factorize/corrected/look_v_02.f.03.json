      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The subject of 'look' in this sense (e.g., 'He looks to be angry') is not performing an intentional action but rather is in a state of being perceived. Thus, it is non-volitional."

      "reasoning": "As a state verb, 'look' in this sense describes a continuous condition rather than a repetitive event. It is treated as a single, ongoing instance."
