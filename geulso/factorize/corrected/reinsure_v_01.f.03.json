      "reasoning": "The verb 'reinsure' describes the act of providing additional insurance, which fundamentally alters the state of financial protection for the patient, typically by increasing or renewing it. This constitutes a change in the level or existence of protection.",

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, stating a fact or an occurrence."

    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "As per the GEUL rule, the frame 'Something ----s something' implies a non-volitional subject ('Something'), which lacks inherent will or intention. Therefore, Modality is neutral or absent."

    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of reinsuring is a neutral financial transaction. Its positive or negative implications depend entirely on the context of the risk and financial outcome."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The instruction specifies that if the `verb_frame` contains 'Something', the action is likely non-volitional. While corporate entities can act with 'will' in a legal sense, the grammatical subject 'Something' points to a non-personal, non-volitional action in this framework."

      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of reinsuring, once executed, is a definite and certain event or agreement."

      "reasoning": "The verb 'reinsure' refers to a discrete act of providing additional insurance, considered as a single event or transaction, even if it can be repeated over time."
