      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something rest_on something' implies inanimate objects or situations where will is not a factor, thus there is no agent's will involved."

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The state of being supported is inherently neutral; any positive or negative sentiment would be determined by the specific context."
