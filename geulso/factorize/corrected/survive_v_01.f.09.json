      "reasoning": "The act of survival itself is neutral, though the context often implies a positive outcome from a challenging situation."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "Surviving, especially 'through hardship or adversity', often involves conscious effort and intention from the agent to continue to live, making it volitional. The presence of 'Somebody' in the frame supports this."

      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "The verb describes a continuous state or an ongoing single event of enduring. While it may involve repeated actions (e.g., struggling), the 'surviving' itself is a sustained state rather than discrete, repeated events."
