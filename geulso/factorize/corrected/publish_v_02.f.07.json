      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something publish something' indicates a non-human entity or an abstract concept as the subject. While a publishing house (as 'Something') has an organizational 'will', the individual 'Something' itself is non-volitional in a human sense. This aligns with the rule that 'Something' frames are likely non-volitional."
