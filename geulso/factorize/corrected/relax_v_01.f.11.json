    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame emphasizes the body part's intrinsic process of 'unwinding' or becoming less tense. There is no active will or intention directly attributed to the body part itself for this change."

      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Somebody's (body part) unwind' describes a process happening to a non-agentive subject (the body part). While a person might volitionally decide to relax, the body part's 'unwinding' is a physiological response or intrinsic change, making it non-volitional for the body part itself."

    "Iterativity": {
      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "The lexeme describes the single event of transitioning from a tense state to a less tense, relaxed state. Even if it's a gradual process, the verb typically refers to the singular achievement of the relaxed state, not a repetitive action."
