    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The state of sleeping late is typically experienced directly or observed firsthand."

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb describes a factual state or event, fitting a declarative mood."

    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "While one might intend to sleep, the actual state of being asleep, and thus sleeping late, is largely an involuntary physiological process and not directly driven by continuous will."

    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "Sleeping late is a neutral event; its positive or negative connotation depends on context (e.g., a planned lie-in vs. missing an appointment)."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The state of being asleep is largely non-volitional. While one might make choices that lead to sleeping late (e.g., going to bed late, not setting an alarm), the actual *act* of sleeping and staying asleep beyond a certain time is not a conscious, volitional action."

    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb describes a definite occurrence or state; there is no inherent uncertainty."

      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "The lexeme describes a single instance of sleeping late. While it can be repeated, the verb itself does not imply inherent repetition."
