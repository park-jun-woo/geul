      "reasoning": "The 'Something' in the frame, particularly if it's inanimate or abstract, implies a lack of active will in maintaining the state. Even if animate, the focus is on the state rather than strong volitional effort to be a companion."

      "reasoning": "The state of being a companion is neutral; its positive or negative sentiment depends entirely on context."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something company somebody' implies that the 'Something' (which can be non-agentive like a sound, or a non-human animal) is in a state of companionship, which is not necessarily an intentional act, especially when compared to a human agent actively choosing to accompany. Therefore, it is non-volitional in this general frame."

      "reasoning": "As a continuous state or ongoing relationship, the concept of repetition as discrete events is not directly applicable. It represents a single, enduring instance."
