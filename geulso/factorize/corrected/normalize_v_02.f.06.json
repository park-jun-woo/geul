      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "The lexeme 'renormalise' describes a single, complete event of bringing something back to or into a normal/standard state. While the 're-' prefix suggests a prior event, the verb itself denotes a singular act of transformation rather than continuous repetition inherent to the process itself."
