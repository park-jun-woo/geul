      "reasoning": "Describing someone as 'sparkling' refers to an existing quality or state of being, not an action driven by explicit will or intention within the verb itself. While one can choose to be lively, the verb 'sparkle' expresses the state, not the act of willing it."

      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "As a state verb ('be lively/brilliant'), 'sparkle' describes an inherent or emergent characteristic rather than a volitional act. Similar to 'know' or 'see', one 'is' sparkling, rather than 'performs' sparkling intentionally."
