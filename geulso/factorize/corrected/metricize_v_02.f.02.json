      "value": "change",

      "reasoning": "The core property being altered is the system of measurement applied to the object, as indicated by 'convert from a non-metric to the metric system'."

      "value": 0.0,

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of metricizing is a neutral process; its sentiment depends on external context."
