      "value": 0.0,

    "Polarity": {

      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "Despite the presence of 'Somebody' in the frame, the action of 'running into' an obstacle often describes an accidental or unintentional collision, making the core action non-volitional. This aligns with other non-volitional verbs for a 'Somebody' subject, like 'see' or 'know'."
