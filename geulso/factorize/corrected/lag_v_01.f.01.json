    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "While an agent ('Somebody') is present, the primary meaning of 'lag' as 'fall behind' often implies an involuntary or unintentional process (e.g., inability to keep up), indicating a lack of strong will or intention behind the action. It can sometimes be volitional ('hang back'), but the 'fall behind' aspect is prominent in the definition."

    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of lagging is generally neutral in sentiment, serving primarily as a description of relative performance or position. Context may imbue it with negative connotations, but intrinsically, it is neutral."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The definition includes 'fall (behind)', which typically describes an unintentional consequence or inability to keep pace rather than a deliberate act. While 'hang (back)' can imply volition, the overall sense of 'lag' strongly leans towards a non-volitional state or process, especially when not specified."

      "reasoning": "Lagging often describes a continuous or highly repetitive process of falling behind or maintaining a slower pace over a period, rather than a single, discrete event."
