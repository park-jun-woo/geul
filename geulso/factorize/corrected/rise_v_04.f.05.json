    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of a body part rising is inherently neutral; its positive or negative connotation depends on the specific body part and context (e.g., hackles vs. hair on a loved one's arm)."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something rise' (where 'Something' is a body part) describes an event that happens to the subject, not an action performed intentionally by it. Therefore, it is non-volitional."
