      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "While involving love/passion, the 'unreasoning' and 'irrational' aspects make the state ambiguous, thus neutral sentiment is appropriate."

      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something infatuate somebody' implies that the 'somebody' does not intentionally become infatuated. The action of infatuating is not volitional from the perspective of the affected individual, nor necessarily from the 'Something' if it is inanimate."
