      "reasoning": "The verb, in this frame, describes a transition where 'Something' acquires a new or revealed characteristic or state, changing its perceived or actual status (from unknown/unconfirmed to known/confirmed). The definition 'be shown or be found to be' clearly indicates this transition to a new state of being.",

  "qualifiers": {
    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'be shown or be found to be' implies a conclusion or discovery based on evidence or a process of investigation, which involves inference, rather than direct, raw sensory experience of the proving event itself."
    },
    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning in this frame is declarative, stating an outcome as a fact."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The non-agentive subject 'Something' in the frame indicates that there is no will or intention driving the 'turning out' of the subject."
    },
    "Tense": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The tense is not specified in the frame, so a neutral value is assigned."
    },
    "Aspect": {
      "value": 4,
      "reasoning": "The verb 'turn out' (as part of this frame of 'prove') inherently emphasizes the final state or outcome of a process, making it result-focused."
    },
    "Period/Point": {
      "value": null,
      "reasoning": "No specific temporal point or period is implied by the verb itself."

    "Politeness": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The expression carries a neutral politeness level."
    },
    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of something 'turning out' is semantically neutral; the positive or negative sentiment would depend on the specific 'Adjective/Noun' it turns out to be."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The subject 'Something' is inanimate and cannot act with volition. The outcome 'turns out' without any intentional control from the subject."
    },
    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "When something 'turns out to be' a certain way, it implies a definitive discovery or conclusion has been reached regarding its nature, hence a high level of certainty."
    },
    "Iterativity": {
      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'turn out' describes a singular point in time when an outcome is realized or discovered, generally treated as a single event of manifestation or revelation."
