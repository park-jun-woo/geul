    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,

    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, stating an occurrence or change."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "While a 'Somebody' is present, the act of 'perking up' often describes an internal, reactive change of state that is not necessarily driven by strong conscious will (e.g., 'He perked up at the news')."

      "value": 0.0,

      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "Gaining or regaining energy is generally considered a positive state or outcome, similar to its hypernym 'recuperate'."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The action of 'perking up' can be either volitional (e.g., 'She perked herself up') or non-volitional (e.g., 'He perked up after the nap' or 'He perked up at the sound of the bell'), making its volitionality neutral in a general intransitive frame."
