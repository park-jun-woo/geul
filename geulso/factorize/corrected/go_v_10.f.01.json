    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,

    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, stating a fact about a condition or its change."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "Given that the change of condition is largely non-volitional (as inferred by the `Volitionality` qualifier), there is no strong agent's will or intention involved."
    },
    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb 'go' itself is neutral. The sentiment is carried by the specific adjective (e.g., 'go bad' vs. 'go hungry')."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "For 'Somebody go Adjective' frames (e.g., 'go hungry', 'go broke', 'go bad'), the change in condition often happens to the subject rather than being an intentionally performed action. The hypernym 'be.v.01' also describes a non-volitional state."

    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb describes a definite occurrence of entering or being in a certain condition."
    },
    "Iterativity": {
      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "The act of 'going' into a specific condition is typically a single event. While the condition itself may persist, the verb focuses on the initiation or maintenance as a single instance."
