      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "As a fundamental biological function, the act is not primarily driven by an agent's explicit will or intention, but rather by physiological necessity. Hence, there is no strong 'will' involved from the agent."

      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "While adult humans can exert some conscious control over the timing and location, the underlying physiological urge and the process itself are largely non-volitional. The generic 'Something' frame for a biological process typically indicates non-volitional action."
