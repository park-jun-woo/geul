      "value": "state",
      "reasoning": "The definition 'occupy a certain position or area; be somewhere' describes a continuous state of existing in a particular place, not an action or a change."

    "CoreProperty": {
      "value": "location.n.01",

      "value": "causal_agent.n.01",
      "reasoning": "Following the pattern in provided samples for state verbs (e.g., 'know.v.01'), the subject of the state ('Something') is identified as the primary participant whose state is described, even if not strictly 'causal' in an active sense. It is the entity being located."
    },
    "SubjectType": {
      "value": "entity.n.01",
      "reasoning": "The verb frame 'Something be' indicates that the subject is a generic, non-specific entity."

    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb 'be' for location typically refers to directly observable or known facts about an entity's position."

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning in this frame is declarative, stating a fact about location."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "As a state verb with a non-agentive subject ('Something'), there is no will or intention involved."

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The state of occupying a position is semantically neutral."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something be' explicitly indicates a non-agentive subject, making the state inherently non-volitional."

      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "Stating that something 'is' somewhere implies certainty about its location."

      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "As a continuous state, the concept of repetition is not applicable in the sense of discrete events. It represents a single, ongoing instance of being located."
