      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "While the subject is 'Somebody', the nature of 'fluctuate' often implies an intrinsic or responsive pattern rather than a strong, intentional act of will (e.g., a person might fluctuate due to an external force or internal state). A neutral stance is appropriate."

      "reasoning": "Similar to Modality, even with a 'Somebody' subject, the act of fluctuating is often a non-intentional or semi-intentional process (e.g., swaying uncontrollably, or a bodily function). It is not as inherently volitional as 'run' or 'give'."
