      "value": 0.0,

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of changing by reversal itself is semantically neutral; the positive or negative sentiment depends on the specific context of the change."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The subject 'Something' in the verb frame implies a non-volitional cause for the action, as inanimate objects do not act with intent."
