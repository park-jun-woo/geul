    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning in a typical frame is declarative, stating an event or process."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The subject 'Something' implies a non-agentive entity, so there is no inherent will or intention driving the action."

    "Tense": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's inherent meaning is not tied to a specific past, present, or future tense. The frame specifies progressive aspect but not a definitive tense in general."
