      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something is hang_ining PP' (interpreted as the verb 'persevere' in a progressive construction) explicitly features 'Something' as the subject, indicating a non-volitional entity. This overrides the verb's inherent suggestion of volitional effort for this specific frame."

      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something *is* hang_ining PP' contains the auxiliary verb 'is' and a present participle-like form, which indicates the progressive aspect, denoting an ongoing action or state."
