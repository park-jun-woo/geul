      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The implied frame 'Something ----s' suggests that the 'Something' experiences or undergoes the rise in status, rather than intentionally performing the action of rising in this context. While actions leading to a rise might be volitional, the 'rise' itself is a resulting state change."
