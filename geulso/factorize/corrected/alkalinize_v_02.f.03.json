    },
    "VerbProperty": {
      "value": "chemical_state.n.01",
      "reasoning": "The specific property undergoing change is the chemical state of the substance, related to its pH or acidity/alkalinity."
    },
    "ResultantPropertyState": {
      "value": "alkaline.a.01",
      "reasoning": "The core meaning of 'alkalinize' specifies the target chemical state of the substance as alkaline."

      "value": "causal_agent.n.01",
      "reasoning": "The first 'Something' in the verb frame is the entity that initiates or causes the chemical change."

      "reasoning": "The second 'something' in the verb frame is the substance that undergoes the chemical change to become alkaline."

  "qualifiers": {
    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of making a substance alkaline is a directly observable process or outcome."
    },
    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, stating an action or process."

      "value": 0,
      "reasoning": "The verb describes a simple, completed act of changing a substance's state."
    },
    "Politeness": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb 'alkalinize' is a neutral, technical term with no inherent politeness level."
    },
    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of alkalinizing is chemically neutral; its sentiment (positive or negative) depends on the specific context or desired outcome."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The action is caused by an inanimate subject ('Something'), which cannot act with intention or volition."

    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb implies a definite occurrence of the chemical change being described."
    },
    "Iterativity": {
      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "The lexeme describes a single, usually discrete, event of achieving an alkaline state for a substance."
