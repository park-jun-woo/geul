    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,

    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's primary function in this context is declarative, stating a factual outcome."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The presence of an explicit agent 'Somebody' in the frame, coupled with the 'do something' aspect of the definition and the hypernym 'act.v.01', suggests that the action is typically driven by the agent's will or intention."
    },
    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The concept of 'finally being or doing something' is semantically neutral; any positive or negative connotation would arise from the specific context or the 'VERB-ing' action itself."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "Consistent with the presence of 'Somebody' as the agent and the 'do something' part of the definition, the action is considered volitional, as it implies the agent's involvement and responsibility in reaching the final state or performing the final action. The hypernym 'act.v.01' reinforces this."

    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb describes a definite and certain outcome or conclusion."

    "Iterativity": {
      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "The lexeme 'wind up' in this sense refers to a single, culminating event or a transition to a final state, not a repetitive occurrence of the 'winding up' itself."
    },
    "Aspect": {
      "value": 4,
      "reasoning": "The meaning 'finally be or do something' strongly emphasizes the resulting state or action, indicating that the verb focuses on the outcome or completion of a process, aligning with the 'Result-focused' aspect."
