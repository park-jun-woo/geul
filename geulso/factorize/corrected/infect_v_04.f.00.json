      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Somebody infect somebody' implies an active agent ('Somebody') initiating the action, which suggests strong will, even if the intention is not always malicious (e.g., 'Somebody' can still intentionally spread something)."

      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Somebody infect somebody' indicates an active 'Somebody' as the subject, aligning with the rule that 'Somebody' implies volition. While infection can be accidental, the verb frame focuses on the causal agent's role."
