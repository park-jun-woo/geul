      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something ----s' is generic. While an animal (as specified in the definition) can volitionally bellow, 'Something' also covers non-volitional instances (e.g., 'the wind bellowed'). The rule states 'If it contains 'Something', it is likely non-volitional or the volitionality is neutral.' Thus, a neutral value is most appropriate."
