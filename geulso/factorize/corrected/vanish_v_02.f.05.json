      "reasoning": "While a 'Somebody' is present, the verb 'vanish' itself focuses on the change of state to being invisible rather than an active, willed action on the part of the subject. Often, vanishing is something that happens to or mysteriously affects the subject, rather than an act of conscious will. This aligns with non-volitional state verbs in samples (e.g., 'know', 'see')."

      "reasoning": "The primary meaning of 'vanish' describes a change of state or a disappearance that often occurs without explicit intent or control from the subject, even if the subject is 'Somebody'. It's more about the event's outcome than the agent's active volitional input to *cause* the vanishing. This is consistent with non-volitional verbs describing states or involuntary changes, as seen in samples like 'know' and 'see'."
