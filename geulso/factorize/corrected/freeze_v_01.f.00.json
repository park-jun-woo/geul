    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, describing an event or a resulting state."

    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "While a 'Somebody' is present, the verb 'freeze' in this sense, especially with 'become immobilized', often implies an involuntary cessation of movement (e.g., due to fear or surprise), indicating a lack of strong will or intention from the agent."

    "Politeness": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb 'freeze' itself is neutral in terms of politeness."

    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of stopping movement or becoming immobilized is neutral; its sentiment depends on context (e.g., freezing in fear vs. freezing for a picture)."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The definition 'stop moving or become immobilized' frequently refers to an involuntary reaction (e.g., freezing with fear or shock), rather than an intentional act. The 'become immobilized' part strongly suggests a non-volitional process."

    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb describes a definite occurrence of ceasing movement."

      "reasoning": "The lexeme describes a single, discrete event of ceasing movement, even if the prior movement was continuous."
