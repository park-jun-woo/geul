      "reasoning": "The definition 'raise scruples' implies an active process of expressing or manifesting moral doubts or hesitation. This is an action related to internal moral processing and its outward expression. The hypernym 'fuss' (worry unnecessarily) also suggests an action of demonstrating concern.",

      "reasoning": "The presence of 'Somebody' as the subject implies an agent who acts with will, either by choosing to express scruples or to let them influence an action."

    "Polarity": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "Scruples inherently involve moral qualms, doubts, or hesitation, which are generally considered a negative aspect in the context of moving forward with an action or decision. The hypernym 'fuss' also carries a negative connotation."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Somebody ----s something' indicates a volitional agent ('Somebody') performing the action of 'raising scruples'. While the initial moral qualm might arise involuntarily, the act of scrupling (acting upon or expressing these doubts) is volitional."
