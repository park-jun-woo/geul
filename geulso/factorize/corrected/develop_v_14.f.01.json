    },
    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, stating a process of change."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The 'Somebody' in the frame implies agency and often refers to an intentional process of growth or self-improvement, indicating a strong will to develop."

    "Tense": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's inherent meaning doesn't specify tense, so it defaults to present/neutral."

      "reasoning": "The frame 'Somebody ----s' implies a volitional agent. While some aspects of growth are natural, emotional development often involves conscious effort and choice, making it volitional."
