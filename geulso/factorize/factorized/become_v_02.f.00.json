      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb describes the subject 'undergoing' a change or development. Even with a 'Somebody' subject, the act of 'becoming' is often a process or a resultant state, not an intentional action directly performed by the subject at the moment of becoming (e.g., 'He became sad', 'She became old'). It is similar to states like 'know' or 'see' which are non-volitional, despite having a 'Somebody' agent."
