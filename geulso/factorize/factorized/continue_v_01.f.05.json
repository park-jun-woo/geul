    "VerbType": {
      "value": "process",
      "reasoning": "The verb 'continue' describes an ongoing action or state, indicating it is a process rather than a static state or a punctual event, as per the definition 'continue a certain state, condition, or activity'."
    },
    "VerbProperty": {
      "value": "duration.n.01",
      "reasoning": "The core meaning of 'continue' is the temporal extension or persistence of an activity or state over time. 'Duration.n.01' refers to the property of existing over a period of time."
    },
    "CausalAgent": {
      "value": "causal_agent.n.01",
      "reasoning": "The 'Somebody' in the verb frame is the animate, volitional entity identified as the causal agent, performing and maintaining the action of continuing."
    },
    "Patient": {
      "value": "activity.n.01",
      "reasoning": "The 'VERB-ing' in the frame represents the patient, which is the activity or state that is being sustained or prolonged. 'Activity.n.01' is a general WordNet synset for an action or pursuit."

  "qualifiers": {
    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of continuing an activity or state is typically a directly observable or experientially known event."
    },
    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, stating an action or process."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The presence of an agent ('Somebody') in the frame implies the action is driven by will and intention."
    },
    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of continuing is neutral; its sentiment depends on what activity or state is being continued."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Somebody keep VERB-ing' explicitly includes a volitional agent ('Somebody'), making the action inherently intentional."
    },
    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb describes a definite process of ongoing action or state."
    },
    "Iterativity": {
      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "The act of 'continuing' itself is viewed as a single, sustained event of maintenance, rather than a repetition of discrete actions. The iterative nature (if any) belongs to the embedded activity."
    },
    "Aspect": {
      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "The verb 'continue' inherently signifies an action that is ongoing or extended in time, and the 'keep VERB-ing' frame strongly emphasizes this progressive aspect of the activity."
