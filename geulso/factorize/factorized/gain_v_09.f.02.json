      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "While weight gain can be unintentional, the frame 'Somebody put_on' implies that 'Somebody' is the subject acting, and can be interpreted as intentionally engaging in behaviors that lead to the increase, thus demonstrating will or intention in the broader context."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Somebody put_on' includes a volitional agent ('Somebody') who, even if indirectly, engages in actions that result in gaining body weight. This aligns with the rule that 'Somebody' frames are likely volitional."
