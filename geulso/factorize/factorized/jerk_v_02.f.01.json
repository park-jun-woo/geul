      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "While an agent ('Somebody') is present, the definition emphasizes 'seemingly uncontrolled motions', suggesting that the agent's will/intention is not strongly directed towards precise or smooth execution, leading to a neutral modality for the *quality* of the action."

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The 'Somebody' in the frame suggests potential volition, but the defining characteristic 'seemingly uncontrolled motions' indicates that the action may not be entirely intentional or under precise control, making volitionality neutral or ambiguous for the verb's inherent meaning in this frame."
