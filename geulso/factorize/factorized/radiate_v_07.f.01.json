      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "While a 'Somebody' is the subject, radiating in this sense is often an inherent emanation or expression rather than a strong, deliberate act of will. For example, one 'radiates happiness' as a state, not a willed action."

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The action of radiating (issuing or emerging) is often a natural or involuntary expression of a state, rather than a conscious, intentional act, despite having a human subject. Thus, it is neutral on the volitionality scale."
