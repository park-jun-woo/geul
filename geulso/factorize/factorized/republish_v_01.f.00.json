    "CoreActionType": {
      "value": "action",
      "reasoning": "The verb 'republish' describes an active process performed by an agent, rather than a state or an involuntary change."
    },
    "CoreActionProperty": {
      "value": "dissemination.n.01",
      "reasoning": "The core meaning of 'republish' is to make content publicly available, which falls under the semantic domain of dissemination or publication."
    },
    "AgentParticipant": {
      "value": "Somebody",
      "reasoning": "The 'Somebody' in the verb frame 'Somebody republish' is the causal agent initiating the publishing action."
    },
    "PatientParticipant": {
      "value": "content.n.01",
      "reasoning": "Although the verb frame 'Somebody republish' is elliptical, the definition 'publish again' strongly implies an object (e.g., a book, article, or other content) that is being made public."
    },
    "RepetitiveAspect": {
      "value": "recurrence.n.01",
      "reasoning": "The 're-' prefix in 'republish' explicitly indicates that the publishing action is a recurrence or repetition of a previous publishing event."

    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of republishing is a directly observable event or action."

    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, describing an action or event."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The presence of 'Somebody' in the verb frame implies that the action is carried out with clear intention and will."
    },
    "Tense": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "No specific tense is indicated in the input, so a neutral (present) tense is assumed for the verb's underlying meaning."
    },
    "Aspect": {
      "value": 0,
      "reasoning": "The verb 'republish' describes a simple, discrete event of publishing, not an ongoing, completed, or result-focused state."
    },
    "Politeness": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb 'republish' itself carries no inherent politeness marking; its usage is neutral."
    },
    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of republishing is semantically neutral; its positive or negative connotation depends on the context and the content being republished."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Somebody republish' explicitly indicates a volitional agent ('Somebody') performing the action, making it inherently intentional."
    },
    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb describes a definite action that is stated as occurring or having occurred, implying certainty."
    },
    "Iterativity": {
      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "While 'republish' implies an action that has happened before ('again'), this specific instance of republishing is a single, discrete event. The 'repetition' aspect is captured in the sememes."
