    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The definition 'as under pressure or force' suggests that the subject's will is often overcome or not the primary driver of the yielding, hence lacking strong will."

      "reasoning": "The act of giving way is neutral; its sentiment depends on the specific context and consequences."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "Although the frame includes 'Somebody', the definition's emphasis on 'as under pressure or force' implies that the yielding is often a forced outcome or a reluctant acceptance due to external factors, rather than a purely intentional act. This makes the action non-volitional."
