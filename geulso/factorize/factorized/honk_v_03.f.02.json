      "reasoning": "Given the non-volitional nature of this frame (referring to an animal's characteristic cry), the action is not driven by the agent's strong will or intention in a human sense. It's an instinctive vocalization."

      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something cronk' (interpreting 'cronk' as a typo for 'honk') describes an event performed by 'Something' (an animal), referring to its characteristic cry. This typically implies an instinctive or reflexive action rather than a fully volitional one, similar to how 'Something ----s' frames are treated for non-agentive subjects."

      "reasoning": "The lexeme describes a single instance of producing the sound. While honking can be repeated, the verb itself does not inherently imply continuous or high repetition."
