    "CoreAction": {
      "value": "Change in state of contact (from non-contact to contact) between a causal agent and a patient.",
      "reasoning": "The verb 'stroke' involves an agent actively initiating physical contact with a patient, thus changing their state of contact."
    },
    "Manner": {
      "value": "The physical contact is light and performed with brushing motions.",
      "reasoning": "The definition 'touch lightly and repeatedly, as with brushing motions' directly specifies these characteristics of the action's manner."
