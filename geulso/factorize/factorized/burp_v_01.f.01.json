      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Somebody bubble' (interpreted as 'Somebody burps') includes 'Somebody' as the agent. According to the rules, the presence of 'Somebody' suggests the action is likely volitional, even if it can also occur involuntarily. Intentional burping to relieve gas is a common scenario."
