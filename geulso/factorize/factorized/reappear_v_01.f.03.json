  "frame_text": "Somebody reappear PP",
  "sememes": {
    "CoreMeaning": {
      "value": "change of visibility",
      "reasoning": "The verb 'reappear' fundamentally describes a transition from a state of non-visibility to being visible again."
    },
    "RepetitiveAspect": {
      "value": "again",
      "reasoning": "The 're-' prefix in 'reappear' explicitly indicates that this change of visibility is a repetition of a previous occurrence."
    },
    "SubjectRole": {
      "value": "causal_agent.n.01 (Somebody)",
      "reasoning": "The 'Somebody' in the frame is the animate entity that performs the action of reappearing. Given the volitional nature inferred, this entity acts as a causal agent."
    },
    "LocationArgument": {
      "value": "location.n.01 (PP)",
      "reasoning": "The 'PP' (Prepositional Phrase) in the frame specifies the location or context where the reappearing event takes place."
    }
  },
  "qualifiers": {
    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of reappearing is typically a directly observable event."
    },
    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, stating an event."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The presence of 'Somebody' in the verb frame, combined with the possibility of intentional reappearance, implies an agent acting with will."
    },
    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of reappearing is neutral; its sentiment depends on context."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "Following the rule, the presence of 'Somebody' in the frame makes the action likely volitional, as a person can choose to reappear."
    },
    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb describes a definite occurrence of appearing again."
    },
    "Iterativity": {
      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "The lexeme 'reappear' describes a single instance of returning to visibility. The 're-' prefix indicates that it is a *second or subsequent* single event, not that the event itself is composed of continuous repetitions."
