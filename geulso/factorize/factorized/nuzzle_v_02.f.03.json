      "value": 0.0,

      "value": 0.0,

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something nuzzle' does not definitively indicate volition. While nuzzling often implies intentionality (e.g., by an animal), 'Something' allows for non-volitional interpretations, making it neutral as per the rule for 'Something' frames."
