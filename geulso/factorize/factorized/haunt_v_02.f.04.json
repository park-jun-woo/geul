      "reasoning": "The verb 'haunt' describes a persistent mental condition of being preoccupied or distressed, often with an element of recurring presence, which is a continuous state, not a discrete event or change. This aligns with its hypernym 'preoccupy'.",

          "reasoning": "The 'Something' is the entity that causes or is the source of the persistent mental state in the experiencer, serving as the grammatical subject of the frame. Although often non-volitional (like a ghost or memory), it is the initiator of the haunting effect."

    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The 'Something' in the frame, often an abstract concept, memory, or supernatural entity, does not possess will or intention in the human sense. The 'somebody' does not typically will themselves to be haunted."

    "Polarity": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The term 'haunt' generally carries a negative connotation, implying distress, unease, or persistent trouble, especially when related to ghosts or troublesome memories, as supported by the definition."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The 'Something' causing the haunting is typically non-volitional (e.g., a ghost, a memory, a problem), and the 'somebody' who is haunted does not volitionally choose to be in this state."

      "value": 1.0,

      "reasoning": "Haunting implies a persistent, often recurring or continuous presence or effect on the experiencer, rather than a single, isolated event, indicating high repetition or ongoing nature."
