      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "Although the agent is 'Something' (typically an animal like a hen), producing a sound like clucking is generally an intentional, albeit often instinctual, act for communication or expression, implying will."

      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "Clucking, even for an animal, is typically a volitional act. A hen 'chooses' to cluck, it's not a passive state or an involuntary reflex, differentiating it from purely non-volitional events for 'Something' subjects."
