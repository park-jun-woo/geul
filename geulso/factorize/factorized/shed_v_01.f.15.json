      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, stating an event."

    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The subject 'Something' can represent an entity with inherent processes (e.g., a tree shedding leaves, non-volitional) or an organization making a decision (e.g., a company shedding assets, volitional). Therefore, modality is neutral."

    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of shedding is neutral; its sentiment depends on the context and what is being shed."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something ----s something' can encompass both non-volitional natural processes (like a snake shedding skin) and volitional actions by collective entities (like a company shedding employees). Thus, volitionality is neutral."

      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "The lexeme 'shed' in this general frame describes a singular instance or a completed act of getting rid of something, without explicit indication of continuous repetition. Though the process of shedding can be iterative (e.g., a tree shedding leaves), the basic verb form typically refers to the act itself."
