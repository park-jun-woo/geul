  "qualifiers": {
    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb 'become' in this context generally refers to directly observable or inferable changes, with no specific evidential markers."
    },
    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The core meaning of the verb is declarative, stating that a change occurs."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Somebody go PP' implies that 'Somebody' takes an active role or makes choices that lead to entering a specific state, indicating an element of will (e.g., 'He went into business')."
    },
    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of becoming or changing state is neutral; the specific state can be positive or negative, but the verb itself doesn't carry inherent sentiment."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "Although 'become' can often be non-volitional, the presence of 'Somebody' as the subject in the 'Somebody go PP' frame, especially with the 'go' implying entering or assuming, suggests that the action is typically volitional (e.g., 'She went pro', 'He went into medicine'). This aligns with the rule that 'Somebody' generally implies volition for change verbs."
    },
    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb describes a definite occurrence or realization of a state change."
    },
    "Iterativity": {
      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "The lexeme 'become' (or 'go PP' in this sense) generally describes a single, complete event of entering a new state or condition, not a repetitive action."
