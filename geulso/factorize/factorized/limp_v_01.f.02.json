      "reasoning": "The verb 'limp' describes a form of 'walk', which is a change in location or state of motion. The input frame 'Somebody hitch' is interpreted as an intransitive frame for the verb 'limp' (e.g., 'Somebody limps'), where 'Somebody' is the entity undergoing this change.",

  "qualifiers": {
    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "Limping is a physical action that is typically directly observable."

    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's primary use is declarative, stating a fact or describing an action."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "Although the cause of limping (injury) is involuntary, the act of walking itself (and thus limping) is generally a conscious effort made by the 'Somebody', implying a strong will to move."

    "Politeness": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb 'limp' is neutral in terms of politeness."
    },
    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of limping itself is descriptive and neutral. Any negative sentiment would stem from the underlying injury, not the action."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Somebody ----s' (interpreted for 'limp') indicates an agent ('Somebody') who intentionally performs the action of walking, even if the manner of walking is constrained by an involuntary condition. Therefore, the action is volitional."
    },
    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb describes a definite action; there is certainty about the occurrence of the limping."

      "value": "MAX-1",
      "reasoning": "Limping, as a form of walking, consists of continuous, highly repetitive steps. Therefore, it has high iterativity."
