    "CoreMeaning": {
      "value": "action of enabling or granting permission for an event/action",
      "reasoning": "The definition 'actively cause something to happen' for 'let' specifically implies an agentive action that facilitates a state of enablement or permission for another participant, rather than direct causation of an event, often by removing an impediment."
    },
    "GranterOfPermission": {
      "value": "The agent who performs the act of letting.",
      "reasoning": "The first 'Somebody' in the frame 'Somebody let...' is the active agent responsible for initiating the permission or enablement."
    },
    "ActionPerformer": {
      "value": "The participant who is enabled or allowed to perform an action.",
      "reasoning": "The second 'somebody' in the frame '...let somebody INFINITIVE' is the participant who is granted the freedom or opportunity to carry out the specified action."
    },
    "EnabledAction": {
      "value": "The specific action or event that is permitted.",
      "reasoning": "The 'INFINITIVE' clause represents the action or event that the 'ActionPerformer' is allowed or enabled to undertake."

    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The presence of 'Somebody' as the subject of 'let' implies the agent's strong will and intention to grant permission or enable."
    },
    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of letting itself is a neutral action; the inherent sentiment depends on the permitted action and its context."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Somebody let...' explicitly indicates a volitional agent ('Somebody') who intentionally performs the act of permitting or enabling."

    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb 'let' describes a definite act of permission or enablement, implying certainty in its occurrence."
