      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something globalise something' implies an agent that causes an action, but 'Something' typically does not possess human-like 'will' or 'intention' in this context; it often refers to a force, system, or entity without explicit personal volition. Thus, modality is neutral."

      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something globalise something' indicates a causative agent. While 'Something' is not 'Somebody' (a human agent), the act of 'making' something world-wide suggests an initiated action. According to the rules, for 'Something', volitionality is either non-volitional or neutral. Given it's an active causative verb, neutral is more appropriate than non-volitional."
