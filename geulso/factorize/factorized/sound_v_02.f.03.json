This interpretation aligns with the common usage of 'sound + adjective' (e.g., 'You sound happy') and the provided hypernym 'cause_to_be_perceived', which focuses on the resulting perception, rather than strictly the act of making noise (the explicit definition of sound.v.02 in WordNet 3.1 is generally for inanimate objects or specific actions of emitting sound).",

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The state of being perceived in a certain way is not an act driven by the subject's will or intention. While the action causing the sound (e.g., speaking) might be volitional, the *perception* itself is not willed by the subject."

      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "Being perceived as 'Adjective' through sound is a passive state or observation, not an intentional action performed by 'Somebody'. Therefore, it is non-volitional."
