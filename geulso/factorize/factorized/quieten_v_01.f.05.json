    "Modality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The presence of 'Somebody' in the frame, combined with the verb 'quieten' (meaning to make or become quiet), suggests an inherent will or intention on the part of the agent, even in its intransitive use."

    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of becoming quiet is neutral in sentiment; its positivity or negativity depends on the specific context."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Somebody quieten' implies that the 'Somebody' is an agent performing the action, even if it is a change of their own state, often with intentionality to become quiet. This aligns with the rule that 'Somebody' frames are typically volitional."

      "reasoning": "The lexeme describes a single event or a continuous process leading to a state of quietness, rather than an inherently repetitive action."
