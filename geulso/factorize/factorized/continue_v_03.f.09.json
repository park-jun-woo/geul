      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The presence of 'Something' as the subject in the frame 'Something ----s something' typically indicates a non-volitional agent (e.g., a force, condition, or abstract entity) performing the action of causing continuance. It's an effect rather than an intention."

      "reasoning": "The verb 'continue' in this sense describes a singular act of initiating or sustaining a continuous state, rather than a sequence of discrete, repeated events. While the resultant state is continuous, the act of causing it is usually treated as a single, sustained effort or cause."
