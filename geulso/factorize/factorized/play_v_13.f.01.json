  "sememes": {
    "ActionType": {
      "value": "emission",
      "reasoning": "The verb 'play' in this context describes the action of causing recorded sound to be sent forth or released."
    },
    "EmittedPhenomenon": {
      "value": "sound",
      "reasoning": "The primary outcome or object of this action is sound, as specified by the definition 'emit recorded sound'."
    },
    "SoundCharacteristic": {
      "value": "recorded",
      "reasoning": "A key characteristic from the definition is that the sound is 'recorded', differentiating it from live sound production."
    },
    "Agent": {
      "value": "inanimate device",
      "reasoning": "The 'Something' in the verb frame refers to the inanimate device (e.g., a player) that performs the action of playing. This is the causal agent."
    },
    "Patient": {
      "value": "recorded content",
      "reasoning": "The 'something' in the verb frame refers to the recorded material (e.g., music, audio track) that is being emitted as sound."
    }
  },
  "qualifiers": {
    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The emission of recorded sound is a directly observable physical event."
    },
    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, stating an event."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The subject 'Something' is an inanimate object, indicating no inherent will or intention driving the action."
    },
    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of playing recorded sound is inherently neutral; any positive or negative sentiment would come from the content or context, not the verb itself."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something play something' clearly indicates an inanimate subject ('Something') which cannot act volitionally, making the action non-volitional."
    },
    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The event of playing sound is described as a definite occurrence or state."
    },
    "Iterativity": {
      "value": "MAX-1",
      "reasoning": "Playing a recording typically involves a continuous and repetitive emission of sound over time, rather than a single discrete instantaneous event, thus indicating high iterativity."
