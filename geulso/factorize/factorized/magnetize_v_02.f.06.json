    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of attracting or being attracted strongly is typically a directly observable phenomenon or experience."

      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning describes a declarative statement of an event or state."

    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The 'Something' acting as the causal agent in the frame does not possess 'will' in the human sense, thus modality is neutral. The attraction is an inherent property or effect."

    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "Being strongly attracted can be perceived as positive, negative, or neutral depending on the context and the nature of the attraction. The verb itself is neutral."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The subject 'Something' indicates a non-volitional agent. The act of attracting in this sense is often an inherent quality or effect, not an intentional action on the part of the 'Something'."

    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb 'magnetize' implies a definite occurrence of strong attraction when it happens."

      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something ----s somebody' typically describes a single event of causing strong attraction, which then leads to a state of being attracted. While the attraction might be continuous, the 'magnetizing' act itself is treated as a discrete event."
