      "reasoning": "While initiating contact can be volitional, the *perception itself* through touch is a passive state and does not involve the agent's will in its occurrence."

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of tactile perception is neutral; the nature of what is touched may evoke sentiment, but the perception itself does not."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb focuses on the *perception* via the tactile sense. Similar to 'see' or 'hear', the act of perceiving is largely involuntary once the sensory input is present, even if the initial contact was intentional. Therefore, it is non-volitional."

      "reasoning": "As a continuous or singular state of perception, the concept of repetition is not inherently applicable. It is treated as a single, ongoing instance of perceiving."
