      "reasoning": "The state of being satiated is neutral; its sentiment depends on context (e.g., satiated hunger is positive, satiated desire for destruction is negative)."

      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The 'Something' in the frame is the recipient or experiencer of the satiation, not the volitional agent performing the action. Thus, the condition is non-volitional for the 'Something'."
