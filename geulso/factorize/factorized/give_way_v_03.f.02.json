    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "While 'Somebody' is an agent, the phrase 'as under pressure or force' implies the action is often compelled or an involuntary response to external factors, rather than a strong, self-initiated act of will. Hence, the modality is neutral."

    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of giving way is neutral; its sentiment depends on the specific context and consequences."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "Given the definition 'end resistance, as under pressure or force,' the action can be either a compelled, non-volitional event (e.g., a structure giving way) or a reluctant, semi-volitional decision (e.g., a person yielding under duress). It is not purely volitional, making it neutral."
