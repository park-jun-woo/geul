      "reasoning": "When a 'Somebody' 'comes to' an infinitive (e.g., 'come to understand', 'come to accept'), there is often an implied will or mental process involved in reaching that state, even if the final outcome isn't always fully intended from the outset."

      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Somebody ----s to INFINITIVE' implies a volitional subject who, through a process, reaches or enters a new state, condition, or understanding. The action of 'coming to' is often an intentional endeavor or a conscious process leading to a result."
