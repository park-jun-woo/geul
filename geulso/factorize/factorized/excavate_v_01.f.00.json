    "CoreAction": {
      "value": "A process initiated by an agent (Somebody) that causes a change in the visibility or status of an implicit object (patient) from a hidden/unrecovered state to a visible/recovered state.",
      "reasoning": "The verb 'excavate' inherently means to recover something that was previously hidden or buried, implying a transition in its state of visibility or availability, caused by an agent. The patient is implied by 'recover' in the definition."
    },
    "MannerOfAction": {
      "value": "The action is performed through the act of digging.",
      "reasoning": "The definition explicitly states the means of recovery as 'through digging', indicating the specific manner of the action."
    },
    "ResultantQuality": {
      "value": "Describes a resulting quality or state (as specified by 'Adjective') of the excavated item or site.",
      "reasoning": "The 'Adjective' in this frame, in the context of 'recover through digging', most logically indicates a resulting quality or condition of the object being recovered or the site being excavated after the action is complete."

  "qualifiers": {
    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of excavating and recovering is a directly observable phenomenon."

    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, stating an action."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The presence of an agent ('Somebody') in the frame implies the action is driven by will and intention."
    },
    "Politeness": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb 'excavate' itself carries a neutral politeness level."
    },
    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of excavation is neutral; its positive or negative sentiment depends on context or what is recovered."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Somebody ----' explicitly indicates a volitional agent performing the action."
    },
    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The action of excavating is described as a definite occurrence."
    },
    "Iterativity": {
      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "While digging can be iterative, 'recover' implies the accomplishment of a specific event for a particular item or site, thus representing a single event of recovery."
