      "reasoning": "The act of shining intensely is inherently neutral; while its effect might be positive or negative depending on context (e.g., blinding), the action itself carries no intrinsic sentiment."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something glare' clearly indicates a non-agentive subject, meaning the action is non-volitional and not performed with intention."

      "reasoning": "The verb 'glare' typically implies a continuous or sustained intense emission of light over a period, rather than a single momentary event, thus indicating high repetition or a continuous process."
