    "Property": {
      "value": "stain.n.01",
      "reasoning": "The core property being altered by the verb 'destain' is the presence or absence of a stain on the object, moving towards an 'unstained' state."

    },
    "Patient": {
      "value": "something",
      "reasoning": "The 'something' in the verb frame is the entity (e.g., a laboratory specimen) that undergoes the change of state by having its stain removed."

    "Purpose": {
      "value": "enhance_contrast.v.01",
      "reasoning": "The definition explicitly states the purpose 'to enhance contrast', which is an inherent teleological aspect of this specific verb meaning."
