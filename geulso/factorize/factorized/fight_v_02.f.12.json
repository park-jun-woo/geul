      "reasoning": "The verb's definition 'fight against or resist strongly' denotes an active process of maintaining an opposing stance or hindering progress. The presence of 'oppose' in the `verb_frame` further emphasizes this core semantic component, indicating a dynamic interaction rather than a static state.",

      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The presence of 'Somebody' as the agent, performing an act of 'fighting' or 'opposing', strongly suggests the action is carried out with will and intention."
