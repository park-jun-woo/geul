      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The subject 'Something' of the frame (e.g., trust) does not possess will or intention. Therefore, Modality is neutral."

      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The subject 'Something' (e.g., trust, confidence) is an inanimate or abstract entity and cannot act volitionally, making the state non-volitional for the subject of this frame."
