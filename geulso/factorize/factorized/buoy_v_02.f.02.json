    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of keeping something afloat is a directly observable physical phenomenon, implying direct experience as the source of information."

    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, describing a factual state or event."

    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The causal agent 'Something' in the verb frame implies an inanimate entity, which lacks the capacity for will or intention, resulting in no will."

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of buoying up is inherently neutral in sentiment; its positive or negative implications depend on the broader context."

      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something buoy_up somebody' explicitly features a non-agentive 'Something' as the subject, indicating that the action is non-volitional."

    "Iterativity": {
      "value": "MAX-1",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'keep afloat' denotes a continuous, ongoing process of maintaining a state against a tendency to change (e.g., to sink). This implies a high degree of sustained activity or constant counteraction, which aligns with high repetition in an ongoing sense."
