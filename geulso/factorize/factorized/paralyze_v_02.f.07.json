      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "To be paralyzed and immobile is generally considered a negative outcome, as it implies a loss of function or freedom."

      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something paralyze something' indicates that the agent (the first 'Something') is non-volitional, making the action non-intentional."
