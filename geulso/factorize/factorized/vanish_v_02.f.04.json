          "reasoning": "The 'Somebody' in the frame is the entity that undergoes and often initiates the change of state to become invisible or unnoticeable. When the action is volitional, the subject acts as a causal agent upon itself."

    "Evidentiality": {

    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, stating an event or change of state."

    "Modality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "Given the presence of 'Somebody' in the frame and the potential for volitionality (e.g., a magician vanishing, someone hiding), the action can be driven by strong will."

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of vanishing itself is neutral; its sentiment depends on context."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Somebody vanish' implies an agent ('Somebody') capable of intentional action. While vanishing can be accidental, it can also be volitional (e.g., a person hiding, a magician's trick), aligning with the rule for 'Somebody' frames."

    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb 'vanish' describes a definite occurrence of disappearance."

      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "The lexeme typically describes a single, complete event of becoming invisible or unnoticeable, not a repetitive action."
