This inherent volitionality, supported by its hypernym 'strive', overrides the typical non-volitional implication of a 'Something' subject in the frame, suggesting 'Something' here refers to an agentive entity capable of such intent (e.g., an organization, a personified concept)."

While the execution of the purpose might involve repetition, 'trouble_oneself' refers to the singular act of engaging in that effort."
