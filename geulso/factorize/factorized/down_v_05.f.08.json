  "frame_id": 8,
  "frame_text": "Somebody push_down somebody",
  "sememes": {
    "CoreAction": {
      "value": "The action involves a `change` in `position` (state) caused by a `causal agent` acting upon a `patient`.",
      "reasoning": "The definition 'cause to come or go down' describes a transition of state (position), and the frame 'Somebody push_down somebody' clearly identifies an agent (Somebody) causing this change to a patient (somebody)."
    },
    "DirectionOfChange": {
      "value": "The change in position is specifically `downward`.",
      "reasoning": "The verb 'down' and the frame 'push_down' explicitly indicate the direction of the positional change is towards a lower state."
    },
    "MannerOfAction": {
      "value": "The action is performed through `forceful physical contact` (pushing).",
      "reasoning": "The 'push_down' component of the verb frame specifies the manner or means by which the downward movement is initiated, implying forceful contact."
    }
  },
  "qualifiers": {
    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of pushing somebody down is typically a directly observable event."
    },
    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, stating an event or action."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The presence of 'Somebody' as the agent in the frame implies intentionality and strong will."
    },
    "Tense": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "No specific tense is indicated by the frame; therefore, it is neutral."
    },
    "Aspect": {
      "value": 0,
      "reasoning": "The frame describes a simple, completed action without progressive or perfect aspects."
    },
    "Politeness": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb itself does not carry inherent politeness; context would determine it."
    },
    "Polarity": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "While 'down' can be neutral, 'push_down somebody' often implies a forceful, aggressive, or adverse action, typically resulting in a negative outcome for the patient. The hypernym 'strike.v.01' also suggests a negative connotation."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Somebody ----s somebody' clearly indicates a volitional agent performing the action."
    },
    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb describes a definite occurrence or state."
    },
    "Iterativity": {
      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "The lexeme describes a single, specific instance of causing someone to go down."
