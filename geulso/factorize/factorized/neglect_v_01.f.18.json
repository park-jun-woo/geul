    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,

    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, stating an event or a failure of an event."

    "Modality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Somebody ----s somebody' implies a volitional agent capable of exercising will, even if the act of neglect is a failure of intention rather than an explicit positive action."

    "Polarity": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb 'neglect' inherently carries a negative connotation, as it describes a failure to do something proper, expected, or beneficial."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "While sometimes accidental, 'neglect' as 'leave undone or leave out' with a 'Somebody' agent often implies a degree of choice, responsibility, or culpable oversight, making it a volitional act or omission."

    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "When an act of neglect is stated, it is typically presented as a definite occurrence."

    "Iterativity": {
      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "For the frame 'Somebody overlook somebody', the verb describes a discrete, single instance of omission or disregard, rather than continuous repetition."
