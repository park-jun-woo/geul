      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The subject 'Something' in this frame can refer to an animate entity acting with will (e.g., 'The fox eluded the hunters') or an inanimate/abstract entity having no will (e.g., 'The answer eluded me'). Therefore, modality is neutral."

    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of eluding is inherently neutral; its positive or negative valence depends entirely on the specific context and what is being eluded."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "As the subject is 'Something', it can be either volitional (e.g., a person actively escaping) or non-volitional (e.g., an abstract concept being hard to grasp). This ambiguity makes the volitionality neutral for the frame."

    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,

    "Iterativity": {
      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "The lexeme typically describes a single, successful act of avoiding apprehension. Even if the state of being unapprehended persists, the act of eluding refers to a specific instance of success."
