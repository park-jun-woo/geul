    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The state of something persisting is generally a directly observable phenomenon or a fact established through observation."

    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, stating a fact or an ongoing state."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something persist' lacks an agent capable of will, so the action is not driven by modality."

    "Tense": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The inherent meaning of the verb does not specify a tense; therefore, a neutral present tense is assumed for decomposition."

      "value": 1,

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb indicates a state of duration rather than a specific point or bounded period, thus neutral."

    "Politeness": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "There is no inherent politeness level associated with the verb 'persevere' in this context; it is context-dependent."

    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "While 'persevere' often has positive connotations in English usage, the core semantic act of 'persisting' or 'refusing to stop' is neutral in itself (e.g., 'the pain persisted')."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
