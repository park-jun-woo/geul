      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, stating an action."

    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "While 'rearm' implies an action, the agent 'Something' does not inherently convey individual will. It could be an organization or system, leading to a neutral stance on the agent's will."

      "reasoning": "The verb describes a simple, complete action, not ongoing or perfected. The 're-' prefix indicates a prior event, but the current action is simple."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something ---- something' implies an agent, which could be an organization or system. Such entities can be considered to act with a form of purpose, making it not strictly non-volitional, but also not a personal volitional act. Therefore, 'Neutral' is appropriate."

      "reasoning": "The 're-' prefix signifies that the *type* of action is repeated, but within this specific verb frame, 'rearm' refers to a single instance of re-arming an entity. The repetition itself (the 'again' aspect) is captured as a sememe."
