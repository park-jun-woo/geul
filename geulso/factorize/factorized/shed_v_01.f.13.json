      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "With 'Something' as the subject, the action of shedding is generally a natural, involuntary process (e.g., a tree shedding leaves, a snake shedding skin), thus non-volitional."

      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "The lexeme describes a single instance of getting rid of something. While the process may occur repeatedly over time (e.g., trees shedding leaves annually), the verb itself refers to a distinct act of separation, not an inherently repetitive internal action."
