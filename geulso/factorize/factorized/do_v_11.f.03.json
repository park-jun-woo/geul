      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of carrying on or functioning is semantically neutral; whether it is good or bad depends on the context or qualifiers (e.g., 'doing well' vs 'doing poorly')."

      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The subject 'Something' combined with the meaning 'carry on or function' points to a non-volitional state or process, especially for inanimate objects. Even for animate subjects, this sense of 'do' typically describes an overall state rather than an intentional act."
