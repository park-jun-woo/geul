      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "While the aim of cleansing is often positive (removing negative elements), the act itself is neutral. The specific context (e.g., forced ideological purging) can impart negative connotations, but the verb's inherent meaning is descriptive of the action, not its moral valence."
