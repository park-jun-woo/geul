      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "Similar to 'know', 'wising up' describes a cognitive shift or realization that largely happens to the individual (as an experiencer) rather than being an intentional action they perform. The 'usually accidentally' note for its hypernym 'learn.v.02' further supports non-volition."
