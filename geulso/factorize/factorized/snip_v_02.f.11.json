      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "Following the rule that 'Something' as the subject suggests non-volitional or neutral volitionality. Although 'cultivate' and 'tend' imply volition, the generic 'Something' in the frame allows for non-volitional actors (e.g., automated systems), making the volitionality neutral overall."
