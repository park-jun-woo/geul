      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "While effort may be involved, 'survive' primarily describes a state or outcome of continued existence, not an agent's active will to cause something. It's often a reaction to circumstances, similar to 'know' or 'see' as states rather than actions of will."

    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of surviving is neutral; the surrounding context (overcoming hardship) often gives it a positive connotation, but the verb itself denotes mere continuation."

      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "Similar to 'know' and 'see', 'continue to live' describes a state that is not inherently a volitional act performed by an agent. While one might fight to survive, the state of 'being alive' itself is not a volitional act, and survival can occur passively or by chance. The rule 'if `verb_frame` contains 'Somebody', the action is likely volitional' is overridden by the verb being a state verb, as seen in samples for 'know' and 'see'."

      "reasoning": "The verb describes a continuous, ongoing state or process of existence rather than discrete, repetitive actions. As a continuous state, it is treated as a single, sustained instance, similar to how 'know' and 'see' are treated."
