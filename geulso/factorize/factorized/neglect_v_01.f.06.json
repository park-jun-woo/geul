      "reasoning": "The act of neglecting (i.e., failing to give attention/care) is often not driven by a strong, direct will to neglect, but rather a lack of will to attend or an oversight, or a failure of responsibility."

      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The term 'neglect' inherently carries a negative connotation, implying a failure of duty, care, or attention."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "Being in a state of neglecting, or an omission ('leave undone or leave out'), is primarily a state of non-action or a failure of an expected action, rather than an intentional action being performed. It's similar to other state verbs like 'know' or 'see' in this regard, despite the 'Somebody' frame."
