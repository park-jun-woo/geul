      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The presence of 'Somebody' in the verb frame, combined with the interpretation that they are intentionally losing moisture (e.g., through physical exertion or a controlled process), implies strong will."

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of losing moisture is neutral; its sentiment depends on the context (e.g., intentional drying vs. harmful dehydration)."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Somebody exsiccate' suggests that the 'Somebody' is a volitional agent performing an action that results in losing moisture, or intentionally undergoing this process."
