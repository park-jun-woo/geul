      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "While mimicking implies intent, the 'Something' in the frame, if inanimate or abstract (e.g., a play, a machine), does not possess will in the same sense as 'Somebody'. This aligns with the rule for 'Something' as subject."

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of taking off itself is neutral; its 'amusing' or 'satirical' nature can imply a positive or negative sentiment depending on context and target, but the core verb is neutral."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something ----s something' typically suggests non-volitional or neutral action. Although 'mimic' implies intentionality, the subject 'Something' makes it neutral, acknowledging that the underlying intent might come from creators if 'Something' is a product (e.g., a movie)."
