      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, stating a process or change of state."

    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The process described ('lose outline', 'blend gradually') is generally not an action driven by a strong, explicit will of the subject, but rather a gradual transformation or passive effect."

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of losing distinct outline or blending is neutral; its sentiment depends entirely on the context."

      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "When 'Somebody' is the patient undergoing the change of losing distinctness or blending, the action is typically a non-volitional process or an outcome, even if the subject's prior actions led to it (e.g., 'He melted into the background' is a descriptive outcome, not an inherently volitional act of melting)."
