    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning in this context is declarative, stating a factual event or process."

    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The subject 'Something' is non-agentive in this frame, and the process described is a biological one, implying no intentional will or modality."

      "value": 0.0,

      "reasoning": "The verb typically describes a singular, completed event of becoming attached, corresponding to the simple aspect, though it can also describe the process itself."

    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The biological process of implantation is semantically neutral; its positive or negative implications depend entirely on the broader context (e.g., desired pregnancy or ectopic pregnancy)."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something implant' indicates that the subject 'Something' undergoes the action passively. The biological process is involuntary and non-volitional for the implanting entity."
