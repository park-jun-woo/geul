      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The subject 'Something' implies a non-human agent (e.g., a system, a tool, an abstract force) which typically does not possess 'will' in the human sense, even if it performs a function designed by a volitional entity."

    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of semi-automatizing is inherently neutral; its positive or negative connotations depend entirely on the specific context."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "Although the process of semi-automating is typically a deliberate design choice, the grammatical subject 'Something' performing the action itself is non-volitional. The action is carried out, but not by a subject with inherent intent, aligning with the pattern for 'Something' subjects in samples."
