      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of beating with intensity is neutral; its sentiment depends on context (e.g., 'sun beating down' can be negative, 'rain beating on the roof' can be neutral)."

      "value": "MAX-1",
      "reasoning": "The action of 'beating' with intensity (e.g., sun beating down, rain beating on a surface) implies a continuous, highly repetitive or sustained process rather than a single event."
