    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, stating an action or event."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The presence of 'Somebody' in the frame implies that the action is typically performed with the agent's will or intention, especially in contexts where 'inhale' is used distinct from passive breathing."

    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of inhaling is semantically neutral; its positive or negative valence depends on the context (e.g., inhaling fresh air vs. toxic fumes)."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Somebody ----s something' implies a volitional agent. While breathing can be involuntary, the verb 'inhale' often refers to a conscious, intentional act of drawing breath or other substances, hence volitional."

      "reasoning": "The act of inhaling, when described, is presented as a definite occurrence."

      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "The verb 'inhale' describes a single, discrete act of drawing in air. Repetition would be indicated by context or aspect, not inherent in the base meaning of the lexeme itself."
