      "value": 0.0,

    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, describing a state of being."

    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "While one can choose to lie down, the 'awake' component often implies an involuntary state (e.g., inability to sleep), suggesting a lack of strong will associated with the combined state."

    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The state of lying awake is neutral; it can be positive (e.g., anticipating) or negative (e.g., insomnia) depending on context."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "While the act of lying down can be volitional, the 'awake' part of 'lie_awake' typically refers to an involuntary state of not being able to sleep or simply being conscious, thus making the overall state non-volitional or at least neutral leaning non-volitional."

    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The statement of being in the state of lying awake implies certainty about that state."

    "Iterativity": {
      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "As a continuous state, similar to 'know' and 'see', the concept of repetition is not applicable. It is treated as a single, ongoing instance."
