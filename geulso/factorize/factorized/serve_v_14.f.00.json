      "reasoning": "Although an active biological process, the action is driven by instinctual drives rather than conscious will or human-like intention, thus indicating 'No will'."

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something ----s something' typically refers to animals. While animals actively participate in mating, their actions are primarily instinctual rather than consciously volitional in the human sense. 'Neutral' best captures this blend of activity without full conscious intent."
