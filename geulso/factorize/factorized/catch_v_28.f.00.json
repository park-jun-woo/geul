      "reasoning": "While a 'Somebody' is involved, the act of 'becoming aware' is often a perceptual or cognitive event that happens rather than being a strongly willed action. It implies a passive reception of information, similar to 'see' or 'know'."

      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "Similar to verbs of perception like 'see' or states of knowledge like 'know', 'becoming aware' is generally a non-volitional mental event. One does not typically choose to 'become aware' in the same way one chooses to 'learn' or 'run'."
