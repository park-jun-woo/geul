    "CoreAction": {
      "value": "cause_change_of_location",
      "reasoning": "The verb 'extract' fundamentally describes causing an entity to change its location, moving it from an embedded or attached state (removal)."
    },
    "MannerOfAction": {
      "value": "forceful_or_with_effort",
      "reasoning": "The definition 'usually with some force or effort' and the implied action of 'pull_out' indicate a forceful manner of removal."
    },
    "CausalAgent": {
      "value": "Something",
      "reasoning": "The first 'Something' in the frame 'Something pull_out something' acts as the non-volitional entity or force that initiates the extraction."
    },
    "Patient": {
      "value": "something",
      "reasoning": "The second 'something' in the frame is the entity that undergoes the change of location, i.e., it is being removed."
    },
    "Source": {
      "value": "implicit_origin",
      "reasoning": "The verb 'extract' inherently implies removal *from* a particular location, substance, or medium (source), which is a crucial semantic component of the action."

    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, describing an event or action."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The subject 'Something' indicates a non-volitional entity, thus there is no agent's will involved in the action."
    },
    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of extracting itself is neutral; its positive or negative sentiment is context-dependent."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something pull_out something' explicitly features a non-agentive subject ('Something'), indicating the action is non-volitional."

      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The description of the event is presented as a definite occurrence."
