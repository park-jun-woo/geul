      "reasoning": "The definition 'be larger in number, quantity, power, status or importance' describes a continuous state of being superior or more prominent, rather than a discrete action or a process of change. The 'reign' in the verb frame is interpreted as a syntactic placeholder for the verb 'predominate' within this specific structure, not as redefining the core state-like meaning.",

          "reasoning": "The 'Somebody' in the verb frame refers to the entity that is in the state of predominating; the one possessing superiority. This aligns with the treatment of subjects in other state verbs (e.g., 'know', 'see') in the provided samples."

      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "Predominating, as defined ('be larger in...'), is a state of being rather than an intentional act performed by an agent. Therefore, it is non-volitional, similar to other state verbs like 'know' or 'see'."
