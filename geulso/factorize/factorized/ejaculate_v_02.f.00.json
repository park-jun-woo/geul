    "Modality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Somebody ejaculate' implies that the action is typically performed with the agent's will and intention, even if certain aspects are reflexive."

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The biological act of ejaculating is neutral in inherent sentiment; its emotional or social connotations depend entirely on context."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The presence of 'Somebody' as the subject in the verb frame indicates that the action is volitional, an intentional act performed by the agent."
