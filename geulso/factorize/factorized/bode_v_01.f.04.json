  "qualifiers": {
    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb 'bode' inherently implies an interpretation of present signs to infer a future outcome, which falls under inference rather than direct experience."
    },
    "Mood": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, stating an indicative relationship or a predictive state."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The subject 'Something' is inanimate, thus lacking will or intention in its function as an indicator."

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act or state of 'boding' occurs in the present, even though the content of the boding points to a future event."

      "value": 0,
      "reasoning": "The verb describes a continuous state of being indicative rather than a dynamic action with a clear start or end, fitting the simple aspect."

    "Politeness": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb 'bode' carries no inherent politeness level; its usage is neutral."
    },
    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of indicating or forecasting is semantically neutral. The positive or negative connotation (e.g., 'bode well' vs. 'bode ill') is determined by adverbs or context, not the verb itself."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something forecast something' explicitly describes an inanimate, non-volitional subject ('Something') performing the action."

    "Confidence": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "While 'bode' suggests an indication, it does not guarantee the outcome. It represents a neutral level of certainty, allowing for further interpretation or speculation."

    "Iterativity": {
      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "As a state verb, 'bode' describes an ongoing characteristic or relationship rather than a discrete, repeatable event. It represents a continuous instance of indication."
