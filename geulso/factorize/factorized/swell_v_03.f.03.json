      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of swelling itself is a physical description; its sentiment (positive or negative) depends on the context (e.g., dough swelling vs. an injury swelling). Therefore, the verb's inherent polarity is neutral."

      "reasoning": "Swelling describes a continuous process of expansion that leads to a new state, rather than a series of discrete, repetitive events. It represents a single, ongoing instance of change."
