      "reasoning": "The 'Somebody' in the verb frame is the entity (a person) that undergoes the change in physical condition."
    },
    "Cause": {
      "value": "solar_radiation.n.01",
      "reasoning": "The definition explicitly states the cause of the sunburn as 'overexposure to the sun', which refers to solar radiation."

      "value": "excessive_exposure",
      "reasoning": "The definition specifies the manner of causation as 'overexposure', indicating an excessive amount of exposure to the cause."
