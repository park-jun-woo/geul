      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "Despite 'Something' as the subject, the verb 'hare' implies an intrinsic drive or will to move quickly, drawing from the nature of a hare's movement and its hypernym 'run', which is typically volitional. The action itself expresses a strong intentionality of rapid movement."

      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb 'hare' refers to a specific, active, and typically intentional form of rapid self-propelled motion (like a hare). Even when applied to inanimate objects, it implies an attributed, almost volitional, drive. This overrides the general 'Something' heuristic."
