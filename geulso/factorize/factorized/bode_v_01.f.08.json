      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, stating a factual relationship or state."

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of indicating by signs is neutral; the outcome it indicates can be positive or negative, but the verb itself does not carry inherent sentiment."

      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something ----s something' clearly indicates a non-volitional subject ('Something') performing the action, as it is a natural phenomenon or state of affairs that serves as a sign."

    "Confidence": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "While the signs may exist, their interpretation or the certainty of the foretold event is often speculative, making the confidence level neutral. The verb signifies an indication, not a guarantee."
