      "reasoning": "The 'Something' in the frame, while often referring to animals (which can have will), is a generic placeholder. The verb itself does not inherently specify a strong will or intention, thus neutral modality is appropriate."

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something ----s' for 'bellow' (as of animal) allows for both volitional and non-volitional interpretations depending on the specific 'something'. A neutral value reflects this ambiguity, aligning with the rule for 'Something' frames."
