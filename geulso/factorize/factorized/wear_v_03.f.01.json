      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Something wear something' allows for non-volitional subjects (e.g., 'The house wore a dilapidated look'). Even with an animate subject, the verb 'wear' describes the passive state of displaying, not an intentional act of wearing in the sense of 'putting on' an expression. Thus, it is neutral."
