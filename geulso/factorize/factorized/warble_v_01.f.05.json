      "value": "trill.n.01",
      "reasoning": "The definition explicitly specifies the distinct manner of vocalization, involving 'trills, alternating with the half note above or below'. The synset 'trill.n.01' accurately captures this specific musical/vocal technique."

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's inherent meaning doesn't specify tense, so a neutral present tense is assumed for decomposition."
