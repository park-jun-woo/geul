    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The definition 'be disgorged' suggests the subject undergoes the action rather than intentionally performs it. For 'Somebody' (e.g., a crowd), 'spilling over' is often a consequence of external pressure or exceeding capacity, making it largely non-volitional for the collective."
