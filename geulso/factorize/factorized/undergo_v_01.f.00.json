      "reasoning": "The act of undergoing is generally not driven by the subject's active will in terms of performing the action itself; rather, it implies being subjected to an external process. Therefore, 'No will' is appropriate."

    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb 'undergo' is semantically neutral. The inherent sentiment (positive or negative) is determined by the specific 'something' that is undergone (e.g., surgery vs. training)."

      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The 'Somebody' experiences or is subjected to the 'something'. This implies a non-volitional role in the act of undergoing, as the action happens *to* them rather than being an action they actively perform, even if they might have volitionally chosen to be in the situation. It focuses on the passive reception of the process."
