    "VerbPropertyAffected": {
      "value": "access.n.01",
      "reasoning": "The core property being affected by the action of 'barring' is the ability of an entity to access or enter a location or domain."
    },
    "CausalAgent": {
      "value": "Somebody",
      "reasoning": "The 'Somebody' in the verb frame is the animate entity who intentionally performs the action of preventing entry."

    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The presence of an agent ('Somebody') who 'debars' implies a strong will and intention behind the action."
