      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The state of something weighing more heavily or overbalancing is typically determined through direct observation or measurement."

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning is declarative, stating a factual condition."

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The state of weighing more heavily is neutral; its positive or negative implications depend on the specific context."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb frame 'Something overbalance' indicates a non-agentive subject, meaning the state of preponderating is a non-volitional physical property or occurrence."

      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "As a continuous state rather than a discrete action, the concept of repetition is not applicable in the usual sense. It is treated as a single, ongoing instance."
