      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The action of 'provide' or 'put up' (in the sense of providing) inherently implies an intention or will behind the act, even if the grammatical subject ('Something') refers to an organization or fund acting on behalf of agents."

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of providing is semantically neutral; its positive or negative valence depends on the context and what is being provided."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "Similar to modality, providing is an intentional act. Even when the subject is 'Something' (e.g., 'The company put up the funds'), it represents an entity capable of purposeful action, making the act volitional."
