    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,

    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The subject 'Something animate' does not inherently imply strong will or intention, as it can refer to non-human animate entities or even abstract concepts personified as animate forces. Thus, a neutral stance on will is appropriate."

    "Polarity": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb 'enliven' implies making something 'lively,' which generally carries a positive connotation of increased energy, spirit, or vitality."

    "Volitionality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "While an animate agent can act volitionally, the general 'Something animate' does not guarantee intentionality (e.g., a playful puppy enlivens a room without conscious intention). Therefore, volitionality is neutral."

      "reasoning": "The lexeme describes a single act of initiating a state of liveliness, not an inherently repetitive action."
