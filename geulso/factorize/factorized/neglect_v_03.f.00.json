    "Modality": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The presence of 'Somebody' in the frame suggests the agent has the will or intention (or the conscious lack thereof) that leads to the state of neglect. Failing to attend implies a choice or culpable omission."

      "value": -1.0,

      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The frame 'Somebody ----s something' implies a volitional agent. Neglecting, even if through omission, is often a volitional act of not performing expected care or attention."
