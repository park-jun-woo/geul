    },
    "VerbProperty": {
      "value": "sleep.n.01",
      "reasoning": "The core meaning of 'hibernate' is fundamentally linked to the state of 'sleep', as indicated by its definition 'sleep during winter' and its hypernym 'sleep.v.01'."
    },
    "Actor": {
      "value": "causal_agent.n.01",
      "reasoning": "The 'Something' in the verb frame refers to the entity that is in the state of hibernating, functioning as the subject of the state."
    },
    "TemporalCondition": {
      "value": "winter.n.01",
      "reasoning": "The explicit mention of 'during winter' in the definition is a crucial semantic component, specifying the characteristic period for this state of sleep."

    "Evidentiality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The act of an animal hibernating is generally a directly observable phenomenon."

      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb's core meaning presents a declarative statement about a state of being."
    },
    "Modality": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "Hibernation is an instinctual biological process rather than an action driven by conscious will, hence the modality is neutral (no will)."
    },
    "Polarity": {
      "value": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "The state of hibernating is semantically neutral; it does not inherently carry a positive or negative sentiment."
    },
    "Volitionality": {
      "value": -1.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb frame 'Something hibernate' and the nature of hibernation (an instinctual biological process) indicate a non-volitional action or state."

    "Confidence": {
      "value": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The verb 'hibernate' describes a definite and certain state when it occurs."

    "Iterativity": {
      "value": 1,
      "reasoning": "Hibernation is a continuous state occurring over a specific period (winter), not a series of distinct, repeated events in the typical sense. It is treated as a single, ongoing instance for that duration."
