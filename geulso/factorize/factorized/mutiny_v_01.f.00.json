      "reasoning": "The verb 'mutiny' describes an action that involves a change in the state of allegiance or obedience, from being loyal or obedient to an authority to actively rebelling against it. This is supported by the hypernym 'rebel', which is defined as to 'renounce a former allegiance'.",
