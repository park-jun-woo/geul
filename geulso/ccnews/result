The parsed version contains several issues that need to be corrected to reflect a coherent syntactic structure. The primary

problems are the missing determiner for **“a”**, incorrect parent links for the dummy subject **“There”** and the predicative

noun **“daughter”**, mis‑labelled dependency types for the possessive **“Melina’s”** and the prepositional object of **“to”**.



Below is the list of all corrections that resolve these errors.

  ]

}

These adjustments ensure that:

- **“There”** is correctly linked to the main clause’s root.

- **“daughter”** (index 25) and the predicative noun **“daughter”** are properly attached to the root.

- The possessive form **“Melina’s”** is properly identified.

- The preposition **“to”** correctly modifies **“season”** (index 29) via the correct parent link.



With these corrections, the sentence parses accurately according to the provided grammatical relations.
