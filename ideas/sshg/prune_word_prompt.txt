You are a highly precise entity linking engine. Your task is to identify all plausible Wikidata Q-IDs or Wordnet synset_ids for a target word from a given list, based on the sentence context.

Sentence: {{sentence}}
Target Word: "{{word}}"
Word Index: {{word_index}} (The Nth occurrence of the word in the sentence, starting from 0)

Candidate Meanings (JSON format):
{{candidates}}

Instructions:

Review every candidate in the provided list.

Identify ALL candidates that are a plausible fit for the target word in its specific context within the sentence.

Your response MUST be only a raw JSON list containing the q_id strings of the plausible candidates you have identified.

If you determine that no candidates are plausible, you MUST return an empty list: [].

Do not include any text, explanations, or markdown. Your entire response must start with '[' and end with ']'.
