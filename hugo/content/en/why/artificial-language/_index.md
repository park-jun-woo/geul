## Subtopics

### Why Does Natural Language Create Hallucinations?
Natural language's ambiguity is a feature in human communication, but structurally and inevitably causes hallucinations in AI reasoning.

### Why MD/JSON/XML Won't Work
Structured formats already exist. But they lack a unified semantic system, schemas are fragmented, and they're not LLM-friendly.

### Why Esperanto Failed
Artificial languages for humans failed because of the "must learn" barrier. GEUL's user is not human — it's AI. An invisible intermediate language has no such barrier.

### Why Not Programming Languages?
Programming languages describe procedures. They cannot describe the world. You cannot express "Yi Sun-sin was great" in Python.

### Why Not Embedding Vectors?
Vectors are great for computation but impossible to interpret. They conflict with the white-box principle. Why GEUL abandoned direct vector manipulation and pivoted to an artificial language.

### Why Wikidata?
GEUL does not reject Wikidata — it stands on it. The classification hierarchy and frequency statistics of 100 million entities become the SIDX codebook. Dictionary below, grammar above.
